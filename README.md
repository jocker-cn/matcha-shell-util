# The Matcha Project

Matcha manages a series of script tools, dividing shell scripts into core scripts and third-party scripts,
and manages them in a unified directory. 
The script content is executed through the Matcha module name and parameters.

Example:

```shell
matcha os test
``` 
Matcha executes scripts from the os module, passing [test] as a parameter to the script.
